Distributed Graph Algorithms
============================
This is an archive of some of the work I did in a class on distributed algorithms I took at [Stony Brook University](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/). The class was a rare one-time undergrature offering of a normally graduate course. The instructor at the time was [Annie Liu](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/~liu/). It is offered these days as [CSE 535 Asynchronous Systems](http://www.cs.stonybrook.edu/~liu/cse535/).

This repository contains the implementations of certain distributed graph algorithms in a language known as *DistAlgo*. DistAlgo is a superset of Python that adds special constructs to Python for specifying distributed algorithms in a high-level and succint manner. DistAlgo programs get compiled to portable Python 3 code. DistAlgo was developed at the [Department of Computer Science](http://www.cs.sunysb.edu/) in Stony Brook University.

The Distributed Graph Algorithms
--------------------------------
1. [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms#distributed-minimum-spanning-tree) *(MST)*
2. [Maximal Independent Set](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms#distributed-maximal-independent-set) *(MIS)*
3. [Shortest Path Problem](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms#shortest-path) *(SP)*
4. [Breadth First Search](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms#distributed-breadth-first-search) *(BFS)*

Each of the above algorithms have been documented with thorough description of their algorithms as well as with specific information about their implementations, limitations, etc. They can be found in relevant sections of this *ReadMe* as well as in the *ReadMe* containing the algorithms themselves.

The version of *DistAlgo* used in the implementation of the above algorithms is **DistAlgo-0.2**. _Note:_ All references have been hyperlinked **in-place** using [Markdown's link syntax](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax#link).

Dependencies
------------

### NetworkX

A graph library known as [NetworkX ](http://networkx.lanl.gov/) was used in this project. It is a well-renown pure Python library that provides several useful features pertaining to graphs. Granted, it was a bit unnecessary for this project, but I was anticipating more use for it than was needed.

### matplotlib

The widely-known library [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) is being used here to visualize the various graphs (solutions, inputs, etc.) in this project.

The file `tools.py` used by the MST solver does stuff like building the NetworkX graph, visualizing it with matplotlib, etc.

Other
-----

### Random Graph Generator

In addition, I wrote a simple random graph generator (contained in `graph_gen.py`) that builds a weighted undirected graph with a user-selected number of ranom randomly-weighed edges between the nodes. It can be executed independently as a script (in addition to being imported and used as a library) as shown below:

        usage: graph_gen.py [-h] [-n NODES] [-e EDGES] [file_name]

        Generate a random graph.

        positional arguments:
          file_name             File to write the graph to, listing the edges of a
                                graph line-by-line in the following style: "A B 2",
                                where "A" and "B" are node names and "2" is the weight
                                of the edge connecting them.

        optional arguments:
          -h, --help            show this help message and exit
          -n NODES, --nodes NODES
                                The maximum number of nodes in the graph.
          -e EDGES, --edges EDGES
                                The number of edges in the graph.


### Token-based Distributed Mutex Algorithms

[Ricart-Agrawala's and Suzuki-Kasami's token-based distributed mutex algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/DistributedMutex) have also been been implemented in DistAlgo-0.2. In addition, [Lamport's fast mutual exclusion and bakery algorithms](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/tree/master/ConcurrentMutex) have been implemented using the built-in Python library ``threading``.

Distributed Minimum Spanning Tree
====================================

Overview
--------
This is a distributed program that implements a distributed [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) solver in DistAlgo.

### Problem Description

A spanning tree is defined as a tree which is a sub-graph of a given graph and connects all the nodes in the graph. The graph must be a _connected_ and _undirected_ graph. A [Minimum Spanning Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_spanning_tree) is a spanning tree whose sum of weights of the edges is the lowest of all possible spanning trees for the given graph.

#### Same graph, multiple minimum spanning trees

If a graph has multiple edges *with the same weight*, then the graph could have several MSTs. This situation can be obviated by constructing a graph whose edges have unique weights.

### Algorithms

#### Sequential Solvers

There are two commonly used algorithms for finding the MST of a graph _sequentially_: *Prim's algorithm* and *Kruskal's algorithm*. To better understand the problem and get a feel for it, I wrote a Kruskal's solver which can found at `Kruskal.py`.

#### Distributed Solvers

Here the nodes of the graph are nodes in a distributed system; i.e. a set of computers/processes where each computer represents a node of the graph and the edge between two nodes of the graph respresent a _communication interlink_ between two processes. Nodes (processes) without edges between are _not_ allowed to communicate with each other.

The best known algorithm that solves this problem is the GHS algorithm of R. G. Gallager, P. A. Humblet and P. M. Spira. [According to Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Distributed_minimum_spanning_tree), there also is a parallelization of Prim's sequential algorithm by Nobri et al. The GHS algorithm could be considered the ***state of art*** for the distributed MST problem. I have implemented the GHS algorithm using DistAlgo, a superset of Python enhanced for distributed programming by Annie Liu, Bo Lin et al. from Stony Brook University.

A pre-condition for the GHS aglorithm is that the MST be unique, i.e. that all edges have _unique_ weights.

##### Papers on GHS

I found two papers online that describe GHS. One is the original from 1983, by Gallager, Humlbet & Spira. The other is an enhanced version of the original (with better graphics, typesetting, explanation, etc.) prepared by Guy Flysher and Amir Rubinshtein. I followed the second one while creating my implementation in DistAlgo.

I've posted PDFs of both papers (found online) in this GitHub repo under the `papers` directory. Links to them are below:

* The [Original paper by Gallager, Humblet and Spira](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/papers/GHS_original.pdf) from 1983.
* The enhanced version of the original [prepared by Guy Flysher and Amir Rubinshtein](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/papers/GHS_enhanced.pdf). (*I recommend this one*)

High-level Explanation of the GHS Algorithm
-------------------------------------------
The algorithm hinges on the idea of a "fragment of the MST". It relies on this property of MSTs:
- *If F is a fragment of an MST M, then joining the node of the other end of the minimum weight "outgoing" edge will yield yet another fragment of M.* Here, "outgoing" is defined as an edge which connects (any node in) the fragment to a node that is _not_ part of the fragment.

The algorithm initially starts out by assigning *each node to a fragment of its own*. It then proceeds to to follow a set of steps to ***merge the fragments*** *over and over again*, until there is only **one** fragment left. The final fragment is equal to the MST for the graph. Additionally, each fragment has a property called its *level* which determines what kind of merge process occurs between two fragments. There are two kinds of merges: _absorptions_ and *level-augmenting merges*.

The steps followed by the aglorithm are:

0. Initially, all fragments are at level 0 and contain just the one node. Additionally, all nodes are _sleeping_ at first.
1. A node has to be woken up before it can do anything. A nicety of the GHS algorithm is that there are no restriction whatsoever on the wakeup process. One may opt, if necessary, to wake up all nodes immediately; or alternatively wake up just one single node. In the course of the algorithm, all nodes will eventually be owken up. Other operations in the algorithm result in other nodes waking up.
2. Every fragment finds its *minimum weight outgoing edge* and sends a **Connect** request over it containing the `level` of the fragment it belongs to.
3. Every time a fragment sends a _Connect_ to another fragment, it enters a "waiting" state (denoted by `FOUND` in the code.) The fragment then, waits _until is either gets *absorbed by* or *merges with* the other fragment_.
4. When a fragment **receives** a Connect, the conditions that determine whether it should _absorb_ or _merge_ with the requesting fragment are as follows:
    * If the fragment it received the *Connect* request from is of a lower level, then that fragment gets _absorbed immediately_.
    * If the fragment it received the *Connect* request from is of a level _equal_ to its own or _higher_, two things can happen:
        * If the fragment receving the Connect _has also_ sent a Connect to the other fragment, they ***merge***.
        * In any other case, the fragment _simply does not reply_ and _waits for *the situation to change*_. The way the algorithm works, a merge or absorption will occur eventually.
5. The termination case for the algorithm is, when a fragment is ***unable*** _to find a minimum weight outgoing edge_. This case means that it is the _only fragment left._ Therefore it must be the complete MST.
6. Finally two important thing to note are:
    * Fragments of level-1 and above, are controlled by a pair of nodes called the ***core nodes***. These nodes are first formed during the initial level-0 Connect exchanges. Nodes sending _Connect_s to each other form a level-1 fragment.
    * Fragments are identified by the _weight_ of the edge between the core nodes. Since, all edges have to be unique as pre-requisite for the GHS algorithm, the edge weight can be used to uniquely identify a fragment.

There is a lot more to inner working of the algorithms, such as how exactly mergers and absorptions occur, how the minimum weight outgoing edge is found, etc. However these details would be too low-level to be discussed in this document.

The following diagram (from Guy Flysher and Amir Rubinshtein's version of the GHS paper) illustrates the fragment *absorption* and *merge* processes:

![Diagram showing fragment mergers and absorptions](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/MST-figure.png)

### Pseudocode
The pseudocode for GHS provided in the paper is quite low-level. I [tried](https://github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/blob/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/old/mst_attempt_2.dis), but wasn't able to directly translate it to DistAlgo. The main problem I ran into it was that, DistAlgo does not provide a way (or I don't know of a way) to manipulate the local message queue directly. The pseudocode uses that ability to "delay" processing a message, by putting it back in the end of the queue. My implementation differs in this aspect and also other aspects that make it more high-level and easier to understand (but less efficient.)

I largely followed the pseudocode as a guide, rather than following it directly. For my implementation I tried, to the maximal extent possible, to *work out the lower level details myself, while simply following the high-level details* of the algirithm as described and shown in the diagram above. The benefit of following the high-level explanation was that, I was able to keep the *big picture* in my head (all at once.) I found that impossible to do with the pseudocode (or with the low-level description, which contains a lot of minute details that are intricately connected with each other.) I found I was able to understand part of it at a time, but to hold the whole thing in my head at once was impossible.

The following is an image of the pseudocode for GHS extracted from [Guy Flysher and Amir Rubinshtein](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/papers/GHS_enhanced.pdf)'s version of the paper:

![Distributed MST by Gallager, Humblet & Spira](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/MST_algorithm.png)

Implementation
--------------
The implementation is in DistAlgo 0.2. There are two algorithms: Kruskal's in `Kruskal.py` and GHS in `MST.dis.py`. I wrote Kruskal's just an exercise early on to get a better understanding of MSTs (and in an attempt to come up with my own distirbuted algorithm.) The relevant program in contained in its entirety in the file `MST.dis.py` in this directory. The `.py` was added to obtain syntax highlighting in GitHub. It is pointed to by the symlink `MST.dis`. `MST.dis` can be run using DistAlgo by typing: `python3 -m distalgo.runtime MST.dis`. Alternatively, there's a script `run.py` which does the same thing.

### Usage

Both the GHS algorithm (in `MST.dis.py`) and `Kruskal.py` import the module `tools.py` which provides a common set of services like handling optargs, constructing the graph from a _graph file_ and visualizing the solution using `matplotlib`. The graph file is a simple text file which lists all the edges in the graph in [CSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values)-style, except without the commas. If no graph file is passed, then `graph-2` is used by default. `tools.py` builds from the graph file, a NetworkX graph object representing it.

The available arguments and purposes can be displayed by passing the `-h` argument to display the help message:

	usage: MST.dis [-h] [-v] [-b BACKEND] [-o OUTPUT] [graph]

	Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a given graph.

	positional arguments:
	  graph                 File listing the edges of a graph line-by-line in the
	                        following style: "A B 2", where "A" and "B" are node
	                        names and "2" is the weight of the edge connecting
	                        them.

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -v, --visualize       Visualize the graph and its solution using matplotlib,
	                        with the branches of the MST marked in thick blue.
	  -b BACKEND, --backend BACKEND
	                        Interactive GUI backend to be used by matplotlib for
	                        visualization. Potential options are: GTK, GTKAgg,
	                        GTKCairo, FltkAgg, MacOSX, QtAgg, Qt4Agg, TkAgg, WX,
	                        WXAgg, CocoaAgg, GTK3Cairo, GTK3Agg. Default value is
	                        Qt4Agg.
	  -o OUTPUT, --output OUTPUT
	                        File to write the solution (MST edge list) to. By
	                        default it written to the file `sol`.

### The Spark process

The `Spark` process is another process that is present in my implementation in addition to the node processes. It's job solely bureaucratic: to start the algorithm by waking up atleast one node, and to finish up the algorithm and present the results.

It accomplishes starting the algorithm by simply picking a node at random and sending it a `Wakeup` message. As an interesting side note, the GHS algorithm allows _any number of nodes to be woken up_ ***spontaneously***. This aspect of the GHS algorithm can be easily tested by un-commenting two lines of code in Spark's main() function. The two lines send `Wakeup` messages to all nodes rather one random node.

Finally, output collection starts after `Spark` receives a `Finished` message from one of the two core nodes. Subsequently, it sends a `QueryBranches` message to every node process, and they all reply with the edges they know to be branches. (No single node knows all the branches of the MST, only which of its edges are branches.) The `Spark` processes collects these results and combines them in a set, then `output`s the solution using DistAlgo, and finally passes it on to `toos.py` to write it down to a file and/or visualize it using `matplotlib`.

### Running

When `MST.dis` is run (by typing `python3 -m distalgo.runtime MST.dis` or using `run.py`), the program produces a long list of output messages, each emenating from the processes representing the nodes describing operations that occured at the node. A truncated example of the output is shown below:

The `999999999` that can be seen conspicuously towards the end is a constant representing _infinity_. The "infinite" weight outgoing edge is used to denote the case where there are no outoging edges. When the two core nodes of the final fragment have received replies from all their branches indicating there are ***no more*** outoging edges, it sends a message to the special process `Spark`.

`Spark` immediately _presents_ the solution, and sends a message to all the nodes indicating the completion of the algorithm. Then the program terminates. `Spark` presents the solution, by first using DistAlgo's `output` and printing the solution; and second by drawing the graph using NetworkX and `matplotlib` if the user has opted to visualize the solution (using the `-v` option). The visualized graph denotes the branches of the MST using _thick blue edges_.

Test Cases
----------
The following are a series of test cases run on the algorithm. The main test cases are enclosed in the files: `graph-1`, `graph-2` and `graph-3`. There is an easy way to verify the solution: Run `Kruskal.py` against the same graph. Kruskal is quite clever; it verifies its _own_ solution against NetworkX's MST solver so there's no way it could be wrong.

### Graph 1

For my initial test case which I used for much of the developed of my algorithm, I wanted to use a graph that was in particular designed to test this algorithm. So I looked online for web pages discussing Minimum Spanning Trees, and I finally came across one that had a graph with all unique weights: http://cgm.cs.mcgill.ca/~hagha/topic28/topic28.html

The following `matplotlib` diagram was generated representing the solution to `graph-1`:

![Test Case 1](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/test_case_1.png)

The thick blue edges denote the branches of the MST (Minimum Spanning Tree).

#### What Happens
Some of the key GHS events that occur while solving `graph-1` are:

* `E` and `F` from a **Level-1** *fragment*.
* `I` and `J` from a **Level-1** *fragment*.
* Both *level-1 fragments* proceed to absorb every other node in the graph.
* In the end, these 2 fragments merge across `I` and `E` forming a _new **Level-2** fragment_ with `I` and `E` as the core nodes.

### Graph 2

I added three more nodes: `L`, `K` and `M` to the previous graph for increased complexity and to test other aspects of the GHS algortithm. The added steps that occur after adding these three new nodes are:

* `L`, `K` and `M` form a  **Level-1** *fragment* of their own with `L` and `M` as the _*core* nodes._
* The `L`, `K` and `M` fragment gets absorbed by the *Level-2* fragment with core nodes `I` and `E`.

The solution to `graph-2` is depicted below:

![Test Case 2](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/test_case_2.png)

As always, *the thick blue edges* denote the **branches** of the MST.

### Graph 3

This is a much more complex test case than the previous ones. I drew a sketch of it on paper:

![Graph 3 Sketch](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/graph-3-sketch.png)

The edge list for it can be found in the file `graph-3`. The output produced by `MST.dis` and `Kruskal.py` can be found in `graph-3-ouptput.txt` (in this directory.)

While writing the graph file `graph-3`, I ran the MST solver several times and obtained these intermediate results:

#### Intermediate Result 1

Once again, the _blue edges_ denote the MST.

This third test case _tests merges between ***Level-2*** fragments_. The final fragment formed at the end of this test case is a **Level-3 fragment**. The `graph-3-ouptput.txt`  file in this directory shows the output generated by `MST.dis` while solving this test case.

### Random Graph with 100 nodes and 1000 edges

This random graph was generated using the random graph generator (`random_graph.py`) in the parent directory. A copy of the random graph used for this test case is in the file `1000edge-100node-graph` in this directory. The solution diagram, while not helpful per-se, is still shown below:

![Graph 3 Final Solution](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Minimum-Spanning-Tree/img/1000edge-100node-graph.png)

The output generated by the distributed MST while solving this problem is enclosed in the file `1000edge-100node-graph-output.txt`.

Distributed Maximal Independent Set
======================================

Overview
--------

### Problem Description

This algorithms solves the [Maximal independent set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_independent_set "Wikipedia") problem in a distributed system where the nodes are represented by processes and edges between the nodes in the graph represent a valid communication link between these processes. The maximal independent set problem is described in detail in its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximal_independent_set). One of its many applications is [graph coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_coloring).

#### Multiple Maximal Independent Sets for the same graph

For one graph, there can be more than one, and often several maximal independent sets. Most algorithms that solve for maximal independent set *involve some* ***random*** *factor*, so we can expect different solutions to the MIS problem in different runs of the algorithm.

The following diagram [from Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=File:Cube-maximal-independence.svg) for the graph of a cube shows the 6 different possible MISs for it:

![MISs for Cube](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Cube-maximal-independence.svg/500px-Cube-maximal-independence.svg.png)

#### Related NP-complete problems

There is another problem -- one that tries to find enumerate _all possible MISs_ for a given graph. This problem is much more harder to solve, and is known to be NP-complete. Another similar sounding but different problem is _Maxim***um*** independent set_ which tries to find the largest MIS possible. It does so by using the NP-complete MIS enumeration/listing algorithm, then picking the largest MIS it returns. Obviously it is NP-complete too. Here I solve for the _Maxim***al*** independent set_ problem.

### Best Algorithms

A quick [Google search](https://www.google.com/search?q=parallel+maximal+independent+set) for "distributed maximal independent set" reveals a few algorithms for solving for Maximal Independent Set. The top among these is [A Log-Star Distributed Maximal Independent Set Algorithm](http://disco.ethz.ch/publications/podc08SW.pdf) by Johannes Schneider, Roger Wattenhofer. Another major one that comes up when searching for "parallel maximal independent srt" instead is Luby's algorithm ([the original paper](http://www.dcg.ethz.ch/alumni/pascal/refs/mis_1986_luby.pdf) and [lecture notes on it](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vigoda/RandAlgs/MIS.pdf)).

However after looking at these algorithms for a while, I decided to instead design my own solution to the distributed Maximal Independent Set problem. Luby's algorithm for instance, seemed a little more complicated than necessary to me. The complication was probably an optimization for performance. It involves (based on my understanding) picking a random set of vertices, breaking "ties" in the set -- i.e. vertices that formed edges in the random set, and doing something else and repeating the process. In addition, the lecture notes and paper on Luby's algorith, weren't very clear on how the interprocess communication was to be modeled. (In contrast, the GHS paper for MST was very clear about this.) However, it was pretty clear to me what the straightforward parallelization (distribution) of the sequential MIS algorithm would look like, so I decided to design my own distributed algorithm based on it.

Description of the Algorithm
----------------------------
### Design

The design of my algorithm largely follows the fundamental idea underpinning the sequential algorithm. The sequential algorithm (taken from these [Luby's algorithm lecture notes](http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~vigoda/RandAlgs/MIS.pdf)) for finding MST is shown below:

![MIS Sequential](https://raw.github.com/arjungmenon/Distributed-Graph-Algorithms/master/Maximal-Independent-Set/MIS-sequential.png)

The core steps in my algorithm are as follows:

* Initally all nodes are in a "normal" state. My algorithm, like Luby's involves a random factor. Initially, it picks a random node and marks it as a `VERTEX` of the MST.
* Next, this (randomly-picked) vertex marks _all its neighbors as_ `OUT`. This means they're not vertices.
* The randomly-picked vertex then performs a search for node in the graph, that is _neither a VERTEX nor OUT_ and when it finds, it marks that node as the next `VERTEX` and repeats the search-and-mark process again.
* It repeats this process until is able to find no more NORMAL nodes. At this point it knows the algorithm has ended, and it terminates the program.

### Conditions and Constraints
Some of the conditions and constraints placed placed on the algorithm and in the implementatin are:

 -  Each node in the graph is represented by a process.

 -  A process/node can only communicate with other processes/nodes 
    that it has an edge with. This constraint is soft-enforced.
    Although DistAlgo allows a process to communicate with any 
    other process, the algorithm does not communicate to any process 
    that it does not have an edge with. (An exception is the control 
    process, which is not key player in the algorithm.) This constraint 
    is crucial has been articially imposed upon this algorithm to imiate 
    real-life networks where there necessarily isn't a communication link 
    between every computer with every other computer.

 -  There's a special process known as the Control Process. The 
    Control Process fulfills three roles: (1) It iniates the algorithm.
    (2) It collects output. (3) It terminates the algorithm.

 -  The control process is not bound by constraint (a), and any process is 
    permitted to communicate to it and it to all other processes. However, 
    the control process isn't absolutely necessary to the algorithm, or a 
    crucial component of it. The initation of the algorithm could be moved to 
    top-level main() function, and rather than collect output, each node could 
    produce output declaring itself as a vertex of the MST (it does this already), 
    and termination could be handled by the last VERTEX node; albeit in a less
    elegant fashion. The control process is overall just a niceity that simplifies 
    and renders more elegant this particular implementation.

Usage
-----
The algorithm can be run by typing `python3 -m distalgo.runtime MIS.dis` or `run.py` at a POSIX terminal. The former relies on DistAlgo being installed as a library.

The following help message is generated when the `-h` option is passed:

    usage: MIS.dis [-h] [graph]

    Finds the vertices of the Maximal Independent Set (MST) of a given graph.

    positional arguments:
      graph       File listing the edges of a graph line-by-line in the following
                  style: "A B 2", where "A" and "B" are node names and "2" is the
                  weight of the edge connecting them.

    optional arguments:
      -h, --help  show this help message and exit

Thee only optarg is `graph` which is a graph file formatted in the manner specified in the help message. By default, if none is specified, `graph-1` is used.

Implementation Details
----------------------

### High-Level Overview

Each node/process can have one of 3 states: NORMAL, VERTEX, OUT.
Initally each node is NORMAL.

The algorithm follows the idea behind the sequential algorithm, and does the following:

 1. Picks a random node in the graph.
 2. Marks that node as a VERTEX, and the its neighbors as OUT.
 3. Looks for another node in the graph that is NORMAL (ie. not a VERTEX and not OUT)
 4. It repeats from step a, except instead of a random node, it's the node from step c.
 5. The base case, is when in step c, no NORMAL node could be found. When this happens, 
    the algorithm terminates.

Once crucial aspect is the search for the next NORMAL node. The random factor is present in this search too. The VERTEX initiating a search _randomly_ picks a neighboring node and asks it to search, and the process repeats recursively (with there being random selections at each repitition.) This (essential) random character helps us obtain **different** results for the program each time it is run.

### Properties of the functions mark(), OnSearch, search, OnSearchReply and the Control Process

This is an overview of some of the _key_ functions in the implementation.

Overview of **mark**():
* Marks a node as VERTEX,
* Sends messages to neighboring nodes telling them to mark themselves as OUT.
* Initiates a search for the next NORMAL node in the graph.
* If none could be found, informs the Control Process that the algorithm is finished.

Functions **OnSearch**(path), **search**(path, source), **OnSearchReply**(path):

 -  These functions together sweep through the graph in search for a NORMAL node.

 -  Initially, the search is kickstarted by mark(). `mark` directly 
    calls `search`. `search` then sends message to all its neighboring 
    nodes, asking them to participate in the search. `search`also waits 
    for replies from _all_ its neighboring nodes before doing anything 
    else. The `path` parameter of `search` allows it to keep a record of 
    the path to be taken to reach it from the marked node. This is used  
    later on by the marked node. The `search` function eventually, after the 
    completion of the search, returns a "path list": a list of paths leading 
    to all NORMAL nodes from the marked node.

 -  Each invocation of `search` is accompanied with a `path` from the initial 
    marked node to that particular node. At the beginning the `path` is `None`, 
    but for subsequent `search`es, the `path` paramter contains a list of nodes, 
    which lists the path to be taken to reach node X from the marked node.

 -  Each time a node is notified to join the search via the message `Search` 
    handled by `OnSearch`, the node checks if it is already pariticpating in a 
    search by that particular marked node (the one that iniated the search.)
    It does so by keeping a record of all the searches it has participated in, 
    in the set veriable `search_requested`. If a search request comes from a node 
    to "re-participate" in the search its already paritipating it, it effectively 
    rejects that request, by sending a reply consisting on an empty path list.

 -  Every time the `search` function realizes its own state is NORMAL, it adds 
    itself to variable `collected_replies` normally used to collect search replies 
    from other nodes. As the search progress and penetrates every last node in the 
    graph, atleast one node (usually more than one) will receive a reply from each of 
    its nodes, and all these replies will be empty lists. The reason for this could be 
    that all other nodes are already engaged in search, so rejected a second/third/etc 
    request for search from that particular node and/or that it is an VERTEX or OUT node.
    In either case the reply from all its niegbors initiates a domino effect, where this 
    node then replies to the node that invoked its search (which had been waiting for a 
    reply from this node), and that node to its "caller" node, and so on. The node that 
    replies first, will reply with a path list that contains only a path from the marked 
    node to itself. But the node that "called" it will receive this along with potentially 
    other non-empty path list. It will merge all these path lists into one, adding onto them 
    its own path in case it is a NORMAL node. This reverse cascade will continue until the 
    replies all merge into one, and is handed back to the original marked node.

More on **mark**() and the Control Process:

 -  The marked node, upon receiving the reply, picks a random path out of the path list, and 
    send it a message `Mark` with the `path` as parameter. This message (handled by `OnMark`) 
    will propogate itself until it reaches the node on the other of the path. Putting this in 
    Python's array/slice notation: `path[0] -> path[1] -> ... -> path[-1:]`
    The final recepient upon receiving the `Mark` will call the `mark()` function once more, 
    continue the process (of marking itself as a VERTEX, OUT-ing neighbors, searching) -- 
    until there are _no more NORMAL nodes left_. When this condition occurs, the marked node 
    will receive as a result to its `search`: an empty path list. At this point, this marked 
    node knows it is the last vertex of the MIS and that there are no more vertices in the MIS.
    Armed with this knowledge, it sends a `Finished` message to the control process, which promptly 
    flips the `done` boolean resulting in an automatic termination of all other processes.

 -  The control process also prints out a list of all the vertices 
    once more (although this could be inferred from the individual 
    output produced by each process as they got marked.) This is 
    accomplished by means of a `Marked` message sent by each process/node 
    when it gets marked as VERTEX or OUT. This feature accomplishes 
    purpose (2) of the control process: output collection.

Running & Testing
-----------------
As stated previously, the algorithm can be run by typing `python3 -m distalgo.runtime MIS.dis` or `run.py` on a *nix console.

These were some of the outputs produced during some trial runs of the algorithm using the graphs from MST:

### Note
Many more solutions different from the ones listed above were found for each graph, but they've been omitted for brevity's sake.

---

Shortest Path
================

The [shortest path problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shortest_path_problem) as we all know is the quest to find the shortest path between two nodes in a connected weighted undirected graph.

Algorithm
---------

The problem was pretty straighforward and simple, so I didn't see a need to research it online. I designed my own algorithm for it. My algorithm is described in the next section.

### Steps involved in the algorithm

1. The inital node, or _source_ node calls a function `newWeight`.
2. `newWeight` sets the "total weight" of the path to _itself_ as 0.
3. It then calls a function `propogate` which sends every neighboring the weight of the path leading from the source to _that node_ as: the sum of the weight to the current node + the weight of the edge between the current node and the neighboring node.
4. As this process occurs, every node receives one or more messages with the weight of a path to it _from the source node_. If the new weight it received is less than its previous weight (all nodes start at `999999` or infinite weight), it replaces that lower weight with its current weight _and_ contintues the `proprogate` / propogation process.
5. The `newWeight` function when being invoked on the target node, prints out the weight and path to it indicated by the message received.
6. For simplicity, the termination/base case was omitted. The algorithm prints out multiple output messages as new paths are received. The last path printed _is the shortest path_ from the source node to the target nodee. To terminate, the algorithm would have to involve additional stuff such as each node sending back replies to the messages sent by the `propogate` function, as well as keeping track of the number of replies received and waiting for the total replies received to equal messages sent at each node.

Usage
-----

The program can be run easily from the terminal by typing `python3 -m distalgo.runtime ShortestPath.dis` or by executing `run.py`.

`ShortestPath.dis` offers several command-line options. These can be listed by passing in the `-h` argument:

	usage: ShortestPath.dis [-h] [-s SOURCE] [-t TARGET] [graph]

	Finds the shortest path.

	positional arguments:
	  graph                 File listing the edges of a graph line-by-line in the
	                        following style: "A B 2", where "A" and "B" are node
	                        names and "2" is the weight of the edge connecting
	                        them.

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -s SOURCE, --source SOURCE
	                        The source node.
	  -t TARGET, --target TARGET
	                        The target node.

The first of these is `graph` which is an input graph. It defaults to `graph-1`. The other two are the **source** and **target** nodes between which to find the shortest path.

Testing
-------

In each run, differences can be seen in the "shortest" paths found priot to the actual and final shortest paths. This factor is random/non-deterministic.

### Graph 1

I used the `graph-1` from MST to test Shortest Path. This is a diagram of that graph, generated using _NetworkX_ and _matplotlib_:

Distributed Breadth First Search
===================================

Overview
--------

The goal of the algorithm is to distribute the task of checking whether an element exists in a given graph to multiple processes. Unlike the other algorithms in this project, this one follows a _processes as workers_ model.

### The processes-as-workers model

Normally a distributed graph algorithm means an algorithm where each node in the graph represents a process and the key challenge is to execute an otherwise simple sequential algorithm over distributed processes where _communication between nodes is ***restricted*** to nodes that have an edge between them_. This processes-as-nodes model is useful as it models real-world systems of networked computers. Hadoop and DHT are two examples of commonly used systems that fit this model However, at the same time, there is also a lot of application for another model: One where we break down a large workload into smaller chunks and try to get them done faster using multiple computers.

One could guess there is a lot more application for this model. On supercomputers the goal is to solve a problem faster. Applications today try to use more cores on a computer and run into the same challenge: breaking down problems to solve them faster in parallel. BOINC and Folding@Home are two well-known projects that allow home computer users to donate their idle CPU time to solve real-world problems. So this is an area with lots of great applications and is definitely worth exploring.

As a side note, solving BFS using the processes-as-nodes model would be very trivial. Both the Shortest Path algorithm and MIS, already contains a search very similar to BFS in them.

### Context to my algorithm

I designed this algorithm myself. The algorithm uses a kind-of workload balancing technique; where first one process starts with "all" of the workload, and then n-1 processes ping this one process for work. It then distributes chunks of its work to each of these processes. (The _"chunk"_ of work here is a chunk of a graph -- or rather, a subgraph.) Eventually some process finishes working on its chunk, asks for more work, gets it, and keeps on working. This continues until every process runs out of work and is unable to get any from the others. When this happens, the processes terminate. 

One **crucial feature** that this algorithm relies on is: _common shared memory._ Common shared memory is not something that is always available in a system. Even if and when it is available there are often serious constraints on how it can be used. Three common situations exist:

1. On supercomputers, clusters and large-scale servers there is usually some “shared” memory -- generally in the form of a massive RAID array. However the latency to access this RAID system would make any algorithm that primarily hinges on a fast shared read-only memory inefficient and unusable.
2. On systems like BOINC or Folding@Home, there is absolutely no easily-accessible shared memory. A workload is shipped to the user's computers, and until the user is done working on it; there is no more communication with the server (workload dispenser.)
3. Finally, we have a much more common system: modern multi-core computers. On multi-care, there ***is*** shared memory. It usually exists at multiple levels: Cache memory (L-2 cache and L-3 cache) -> Main memory (RAM) -> Secondary storage (SSD/HDD) -> Tertiary storage (tape backup, etc.) Tertiary is uncommon, but the others are all common.

The processes-as-workers model _with shared memory_ works best in the last situation. Generaly on a multi-core computer, there is local storage *at each* core -- registers and L-1 cahce. Then, there's cache shared between the cores: L-2 and L-3. After that we have RAM, and so on.

Even though the cores share a common memory like L-2 cache, the CPU handles all the trouble of maintatin its integrity, i.e. handling cache conflicts and maintaining cache collisions. THis is usally handled by a marking a segment of a cahce as _dirty_ when its been written to in its L-1 mirror by some core. Then when a different core tries to read it, the CPU updates the value on L-2 to mirror the newer L-1 value.

The result of all this is, it gives programmers the same experience writing programs on multi-core systems as they had writing multi-threaded programs on single-core computers. Needless to say, it's not a very good experience. There is a solution to this however. Forget writing to shared memory -- only read from it. With _shared ***read-only*** memory we can mitigate cache cohesion and related problems. In [Andrew Tanenbaum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Tanenbaum)'s book on [Operating Systems](http://www.amazon.com/Operating-Systems-Design-Implementation-Edition/dp/0136386776), he talks about microkernels, where every little piece of the OS runs in its own little process. They communicate with each other just as in a distributed system.

In DistAlgo, we can model this situation _very well_. When we create new processes in DistAlgo, _all the global context is ***copied***_ into every process (based on my understanding.) In a more efficient the variables would not be copied, but rather be _shared read-only_ at the OS-level, but our main interest here is to create an exemplary prototype rather than a deployable implementation.

Implementation
--------------

### Usage

The algorithm is contained in one file: `BFS.dis.py`. It can be run using `run.py` or using DistAlgo directly like this: `python3 -m distalgo.runtime BFS.dis`. The program offers the following options (disaplyed using the `-h` optarg):

	usage: BFS.dis [-h] [-w WORKERS] [-n NODES] [-e EDGES]

	Perform breadth-first search on a random graph in paralell using several
	workers.

	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  -w WORKERS, --workers WORKERS
	                        Number of workers to do the search. [Default 4]
	  -n NODES, --nodes NODES
	                        The maximum number of nodes in the random graph. [Default 6]
	  -e EDGES, --edges EDGES
	                        The number of edges to in the random graph. [Default 10]

The first command line option allows the user to select the number of worker processes that should be started. The next two control the nature of the random graph generated by `graph_gen.py`. Tinker with those values to produces different sized graphs and control its connectedness.

Detailed Algorithm Description
------------------------------
The algorithm performs a traditional breadth-first search at every node, but also tries to distribute the workload of sweeping through the graph evenly to all processes/workers. Instead of passing around chunks of the graph, it simply passes an un-inspected node to other processes. This node could itself point to other nodes and so on recursively -- so the other process effectively has a sub-graph to work on. It is only when the a process has run into leaf nodes (in the case of a tree), or graph with no more unvisited neighboring edges, does it run out of work. The processes thus work in parallel to prune the graph and find the element being looked for. More details on the algorithm can be found below.

The graph itself is a shared data structure. No one writes to the graph or modifies it in anyway. The graph is frozen before the processes are setup. Due to the read-only nature of the graph any type of mediation is unnecessary here.

In this algorithm, each process has a queue. This queue contains a set of nodes to be inspected. This queue is called the ‘work queue’. Initially the work queue of all but the first process is empty. Right before the processes start, the main function pushes the root node of the graph onto the first process’ queue.

Every process with a non-empty work queue (initially only process 0) starts out by popping an element from its queue and inspecting it. If the element turns out not to be the element being searched for, then the process adds all the child nodes (if any) of the recently inspected element to the queue.

The rest of the processes; lacking any work to do (due to their work queue being empty), broadcast a request for work to all of the other processes. In response to this request for work, every process that has a work queue with 2 or more elements replies by popping an element from its work queue and sending it _unexamined_ to the process requesting work. Initially, Process 0 is the only process with a non-empty work queue – consequently it is process 0 that hands out (“distributes”) the work to all of the other processes.

So initially all of the other processes quickly receive a node each from process 0. Then, each process, on its own begins to examine the node that they currently have in the breadth-first-search manner. As such, the graph has been divided into a several chunks among the processes and all of them are going through it in parallel.

In due course, one of the processes might reach the leaf nodes of the chunk of the graph that was given to it. When this happens, the process ends up with an empty work queue, and it once again sends out requests for work to all of the processes. This time unlike before, it could potentially receive up to *n-1* replies with a node each since all processes could potentially have a non-empty work queue. The fact that it received more than one reply however should not have any adverse affect on the performance of the algorithm. On the contrary, it should reduce the likelihood of an imminent successive request for work by the same process.

When a process eventually encounters a node that matches the value of the element being searched for, the process marks itself as “completed” and immediately sends out a notification to all other processes of “completion.” Subsequently all other processes receive this notification and mark themselves as “completed”. `completed` here is a Boolean private to each process which ceases the execution of the process. When `BFS.dis` is run, you can see special output made by the processes when it reaches the completion stage.

The other alternate termination state is that, the element was not found in the graph. When this happens it is not as easy for each process to know that the graph has been completely pruned since they’re all working on separate chunks of the graph. The algorithm handles this problem by using a set variable called “unserviced” private to each process. Anytime a process receives a request for work from another process and is unable to service it, it adds that process to this set. When the case of element not being found occurs, every process begins to starve – since all of their work queues run dry. When this happens, the size of the “unserviced” set slowly builds up. The same DistAlgo `await` condition that waits for work or completion, also checks if the number of unserviced processes = the number of other processes. When this condition is satisfied it knows that the search was unsuccessful and the element is not in the graph.

Testing & Caveats
-----------------
When run, each node prints a message for each node it inspects. It also prints messages when it requests work from another process, receives a request for work, gets work, etc.

In this test run, we look out for the non-existent value `3545`. As each process is work-starved, it terminates itself. The result (shown above) means that a node with that value does not exist in the graph.

### Longer Sample Test Run

The file `test_run_10_100_200.txt` contains the output of running `./run.py -w 10 -n 100 -e 200`. It's much longer (and therefore more interesting) than the previous ones.

### Caveats

Overall, with medium-sized graphs (about a thousands nodes); this BFS algorithm works fine and does what it’s supposed to do. However when handling large graph sizes, it may or may not run into problems. This is because currently DistAlgo has a limit on how large the size of a message send between processes can be. The way the algorithm is implemented; in response to a work request, it sends a list of all nodes it has visited so far. This is to avoid re-visiting already inspected nodes, and to _effectively_ turn the graph into a tree. The algorithm does not take packet loss into consideration, so when it occurs the behavior of the algorithm is undefined.
